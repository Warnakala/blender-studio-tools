## How to Update Build Server & Clients
To update Client Workstations; the Build Server will pull all of the latest changes from the [main gentoo repository](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository#:~:text=The%20Gentoo%20ebuild%20repository%20is%20the%20main%20ebuild%20repository%20for,to%20be%20available%20to%20Portage.) and compile a system update. When done, it will ask if you want to push out the compiled changes to the clients. The clients ask for updates to be pushed from the build server every five minutes. If the build server signals that there are updates, the clients will perform a sync, downloading the compiled packages from the build server and installing all updated packages.

1. `ssh user@build-server-addr` connect to your build server via ssh
2. Use `su` to Login as root or login as root directly
3. `cd` to change directory to the root home folder
4. Run `./update_build_server.sh`


## Update Add-ons in `/shared/software/addons`

 The software inside the `shared/software/addons` directory are the [Blender Studio Pipeline Add-ons](/addons/overview), the [Flamenco](https://flamenco.blender.org/) Add-on and any other Add-ons that need to be distributed to all Blender Studio Users. These Add-ons are considered Live Packages. Live Packages are packages that fetch updates from the source repository directly and are not tied to a specific release. To update packages not included in `/shared/software/addons` see [Installing Software](/user-guide/workstations/installing-software)

::: warning Temporary Solution
This is a temporary solution that will be depreciated and replaced with project based Add-ons.
::: 

1. `ssh user@build-server-addr` connect to your build server via ssh
2. Use `su` to Login as root or login as root directly
3. Run `emerge --oneshot {package-name}` to update a live package.
    - Run `emerge --oneshot flamenco` to update the [Flamenco](https://flamenco.blender.org/) worker/add-on
    - Run `emerge --oneshot blender-studio-tools` to update the studio Add-ons
4. Run `date -R > /var/cache/update_info/timestamp.chk` to mark this update as the latest

::: info Info
The command `emerge --oneshot {package-name}` compiles package, but does not add the packages to the [@world](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/World_set_(Portage)), this means these packages will be removed when running `--depclean`.. We add this because these packages are already pulled in by another set. So we donâ€™t want to add it again to the @world set. To learn more visit the [Gentoo  Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Emerge#:~:text=fetchonly%20%2D%2Demptytree%20%40world-,Do%20not%20add%20dependencies%20to%20the%20world%20file,-If%20a%20dependency)

### How to update to specific version?
In some cases, users may want to specify what version of an add-on to deploy into the `/shared/software/addons` folder. Users can accomplish this using `eclass` variables found in the [Gentoo Devmanual](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/git-r3.eclass/index.html#:~:text=more%20creative%20ways.-,EGIT_BRANCH,-The%20branch%20name).  
- Run `EGIT_COMMIT=<hash> emerge {package-name}` to update to a specific commit 
- Run `EGIT_BRANCH=<branch> emerge {package-name}` to update to a specific branch 
- Run `EGIT_COMMIT=<hash> EGIT_BRANCH=<branch> emerge {package-name}` to update to a specific commit with in a specific branch 
## Wake on LAN
Wake on LAN is used turn on computers from a "low power" or sleeping state so they can be updated. Wake on LAN uses the hardware information provided by the clients to immediately wake up all that are currently offline. The following guide covers how to parse the hardware info sent by client computers and to use that information to wake any sleeping computers via Wake on LAN.

::: info Will Computers Turn Off after updating?
If this is used in combination with a system update, the client computers will turn off after the system update has completed. (Unless any users are logged into the system when the update finishes).
:::

1. `ssh user@build-server-addr` connect to your build server via ssh
2. Use `su` to Login as root or login as root directly
3. `cd` to change directory to the root home folder
4. `mkdir comps` To create a folder to store parsed client hardware info if none exists
5. `parse_output.py /var/studio_scripts/hw_data/* comps/` to parse client hardware info 
6. Run  `./wol_shared_comps.py comps/*` to wake any computers that are asleep
