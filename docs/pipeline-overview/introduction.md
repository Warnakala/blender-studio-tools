# Introduction

::: warning Work in Progress
30 Apr. 2023 - The content of this page is currently being edited/updated.
:::

This section of the Blender Studio site is dedicated to collecting and documenting the studio's pipeline knowledge. It should be considered a 'live' document, and some content might be out of date (not reflecting the current practices) but nevertheless worth sharing for historical reasons.

The goal is to enable creative teams to easily adopt and build a Blender pipeline.


## How to read/write the docs

We should structure this documentation keeping two possible uses in mind:

* **Design docs** (explanations and insight on why things are built in a certain way)
* **Guides**, for two audiences:
  * users/artists learning how to perform certain workflows
  * TDs learning how to deploy and maintain the pipeline in a production environment


## Design Docs

* Design principles (use Blender as much as possible, use add-ons only when needed, rely on Blender's linking system)
* Breakdown per department/workflow
  * Editorial/previz
  * Concept design 
  * Caracter creation
    * Modeling
    * Shading
    * Rigging
  * Animation pipeline
  * Shot assembly (shot builder)
  * Task review
  * Shading and lighting pipelines
  * Rendering pipeline
  * Coloring

These topics can be described at a high-level, and *reference* specific tools, add-ons and worfklows in a dedicated section.


## References

* Workstation manual
* Workflows (like Design Docs above, but the practical steps). Depending on the type of production, workflows often need to be changed and tweaked. That part can better be documented on the Blender Studio blog.
* Media Viewer
* Infrastructure setup (how to build a studio from scratch)

For "external" tools like Flamenco or Kitsu, the idea is to explain the specific use or customization we do a Blender Studio and refer to the official documentation for the rest. For example: "Install Kitsu by following the official guide".
