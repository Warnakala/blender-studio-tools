# Editorial and Previsualization

At Blender Studio we use the Blender VSE to create and maintain a story edit. A couple of reference links for now:

* [Charge Previsualization](https://studio.blender.org/blog/charge-previsualization/)
* [Story Pencil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b25kfE6qd_c) - Currently not used at Blender Studio, but worth checking when working with storyboard artists.
